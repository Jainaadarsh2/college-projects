As part of a team project, I designed and implemented a Greenhouse Monitoring and Control System aimed at optimizing plant growth conditions and resource usage. The system utilized a combination of sensors, actuators, and microcontrollers to monitor environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, and soil moisture levels within the greenhouse. The collected data was processed and analyzed using embedded systems to provide real-time insights into the greenhouse environment
